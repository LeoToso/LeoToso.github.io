Hello! I'm Leo, a Presidential Fellow and second-year Ph.D. student in the [Departement of Electrical Engineering at Columbia University](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/), New York. At Columbia, I work with [James Anderson](https://www.columbia.edu/~ja3451/). Prior to joining Columbia, I was an undergrad research assistant in the Department of Engineering Science at the University of Oxford, under the supervision of [Stephen Duncan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=l99dKkMAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Ross Drummond](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7eI7h3UAAAAJ&hl=en). I was awarded my MSc in Control, Signal, and Image Processing from the University of Paris-Saclay and the MEng in Control Engineering from CentraleSup√©lec in 2022, where I worked with [Giorgio Valmorbida](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FgtzOj0AAAAJ&hl=en). In addition, I received my BSc in Electrical Engineering from the University of Campinas (Unicamp) in 2022, working with [Matheus Souza](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DeQYj8QAAAAJ&hl=en).
