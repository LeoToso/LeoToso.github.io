I'm a Presidential and CAIRFI (Center for AI and Responsible Financial Innovation) fellow and a third-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Columbia University, where I'm advised by Prof. [James Anderson](https://www.columbia.edu/~ja3451/). Before joining Columbia, I was an undergraduate research assistant in the Department of Engineering Science at the University of Oxford. I was awarded my M.S. in Control, Signal, and Image Processing from the University of Paris-Saclay and the M.Eng. in Electrical Engineering from CentraleSup√©lec both in 2022. In addition, I received my B.Eng. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Campinas (Unicamp) also in 2022.


Research Interests
------

My research interests lie at the intersection of <b>control theory</b>, <b>machine learning</b>, and <b>optimization</b>. 


Collaborators
------
Over the past year, I had the pleasure of collaborating with brilliant people:

<b>Students:</b> [Han Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ALzWbZQAAAAJ&hl=en) (FL for estimation and control), [Thomas Zhang](https://thomaszh3.github.io/) (multi-task rep. learning), [Bruce D. Lee](https://brucedlee.github.io/) (adaptive control), [Donglin Zhan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=SkUje2YAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) (meta-learning LQR). 


<b>Professors:</b> [James Anderson](https://www.columbia.edu/~ja3451/) (Columbia University), [Nikolai Matni](https://nikolaimatni.github.io/) (UPenn), [Aritra Mitra](https://amitra2.wordpress.ncsu.edu/) (NC State University).
