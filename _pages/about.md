Hello! I'm Leo, a presidential fellow and second-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Columbia University, where I am advised by [James Anderson](https://www.columbia.edu/~ja3451/). Before joining Columbia, I was an undergrad research assistant in the Department of Engineering Science at the University of Oxford, working with [Stephen Duncan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=l99dKkMAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Ross Drummond](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7eI7h3UAAAAJ&hl=en). I was awarded my M.S. in Control, Signal, and Image Processing from the University of Paris-Saclay and the M.Eng. in Control Engineering from CentraleSup√©lec in 2022, where I worked with [Giorgio Valmorbida](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FgtzOj0AAAAJ&hl=en). In addition, I received my B.Eng. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Campinas (Unicamp) in 2022, working with [Matheus Souza](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DeQYj8QAAAAJ&hl=en). You can find out more about my research and professional expirience in my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KMEcRGXyzPxKzNBeniAHbScL-8E_HuDe/view?usp=sharing). 



Research Interests
------

My research interests lie in the intersection between <b>control theory</b>, <b>machine learning</b>, and <b>optimization</b>.
